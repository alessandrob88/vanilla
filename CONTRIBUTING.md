Follow this guide if you wish to help with the development of this community project.

## Purpose

Any community on Discord could use a little help managing the day to day activities and delivering to its user the best possible experience.

There's a lot of bots available out there, but carelessly adding bots to gather all the features we like might be cumbersome and add too much overhead.

This project aims to reduce this overhead developing a bot for the community and with the community.

## Get ready

If you know JavaScript, brilliant!

You'll need to:

- Setup your local machine
- Create for free a Discord developer account

### Local machine setup

1. Install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS (using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or similar library is highly recommended).
1. Clone this repository
1. Execute `npm install`

### Discord developer account (free)
