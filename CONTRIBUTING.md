## Purpose

Any community on Discord could use a little help managing the day to day activities and delivering to its user the best possible experience.

There are a lot of bots available out there, but carelessly adding bots to gather all the features we like might be cumbersome and adding too much overhead.

This project aims reduce this overhead developing a bot for the community and with the community.
